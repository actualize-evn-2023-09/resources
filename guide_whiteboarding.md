# Guide: Whiteboard Interview

#### Rule #1: A.B.C - Always Be Chatting!

### Clarify - 5%

- Give **three example inputs** with the **expected outputs** (describe the data types for both).
- Try to come up with edge cases (e.g. empty arrays, negative numbers)
- Ask the interviewer to confirm the input/output is correct & ask any clarifying questions.

### Visualize - 70%

- Solve the problem without using code (using visuals, pseudocode, charts, etc).
- If you’re stuck, decompose the problem and solve a simpler problem first.
- You should develop **complete** clarity so that you can write the code almost without any additional thinking. Make sure you’ve already worked out every detail such as what type of loop you’ll use and what variables you’ll be setting.

### Code - 10%

- Convert your visualized solution into actual code.
- Describe each step out loud as you write the code.

### Debug - 10%

- Use the example input to see if your approach produces the expected output.
- Walk through your code line by line _as if you are the computer_
- Keep track of variables (by writing them down!) as they get updated

### Refactor - 5%

- Describe the efficiency of your algorithm using **Big O notation**.
- Describe or implement any possible changes to improve its efficiency or readability.

## In case of emergency

### _(What to do when you’re definitely, completely, absolutely stuck.)_

- If you’re stuck during the Coding phase, go back to Visualization!
- Articulate what you know and what you don’t know.
- Find a simpler version of the problem, and state that you will solve that one first instead. (Afterwards, take another stab at the more complex problem again.)
- If you have absolutely nothing left to say, engage the interviewer in conversation: “What do you think about the approach I’m taking so far?”
